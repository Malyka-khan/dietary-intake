Overview
This project uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify images of food items and estimate their calorie content. The model predicts the type of food in the image, and based on the prediction, the program provides a rough estimate of the calorie content.

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

tensorflow
numpy
pillow
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
How It Works
Image Classification:

The pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, which is trained on the ImageNet dataset, is used to classify food images.
The input image is resized to 224x224 pixels, preprocessed, and fed into the model to get the top-3 predictions.
Calorie Estimation:

A simple dictionary (calorie_dict) is used to map food items to their approximate calorie content.
The top prediction from the model is used to estimate the calories, based on the dictionary.
Code Structure
1. Loading the Pre-trained Model
The code loads the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model with weights trained on the ImageNet dataset:

python
Copy code
model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')
2. Image Classification
The function classify_image(img_path) loads and preprocesses an image, then uses the model to predict the food item:

python
Copy code
def classify_image(img_path):
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
    img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)

    predictions = model.predict(img_array)
    decoded_predictions = decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]
    
    return decoded_predictions
3. Calorie Estimation
The function get_calories(food_name) retrieves the calorie information for the predicted food item from the dictionary:

python
Copy code
def get_calories(food_name):
    return calorie_dict.get(food_name.lower(), "Calorie information not available")
4. Main Function
The main() function runs the image classification and calorie estimation pipeline:

python
Copy code
def main():
    img_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'  # Replace with your image path
    predictions = classify_image(img_path)
    
    print("Top predictions:")
    for pred in predictions:
        print(f"{pred[1]}: {pred[2]*100:.2f}%")

    food_name = predictions[0][1]
    calories = get_calories(food_name)
    print(f"Estimated calories for {food_name}: {calories}")
5. Running the Program
To run the program, replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' in the main() function with the path to your image file. The program will display the top-3 predictions and estimate the calories based on the top prediction.

Example Output
If you run the program with an image of a pizza, the output might look like this:

yaml
Copy code
Top predictions:
pizza: 75.32%
cheeseburger: 12.45%
bagel: 5.67%
Estimated calories for pizza: 266
Limitations
The calorie estimation is basic and based on averages. It may not be accurate for all instances of the food items.
The dictionary only includes a few food items. You can expand it by adding more food items and their corresponding calorie values.
Conclusion
This project provides a simple way to classify food images and estimate their calorie content using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. It's a starting point for more advanced applications that could include more accurate calorie tracking and recognition of a wider variety of food items.
